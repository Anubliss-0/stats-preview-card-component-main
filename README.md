## My process

I started by viewing the design on Figma, I started by designing for desktop first before running into problems and restarting the project.
Second time around I designed for both desktop and mobile browsing at the same time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The justify-content and align-items properties are affected if the flow of flex box has been changed!
